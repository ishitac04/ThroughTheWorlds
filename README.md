# What it is/does 
My project is called Through The Worlds, a platformer running game with different levels, where you help Maia make it home from her mission in space. You use the spacebar to jump over the obstacles, and shoot robots with the shift key.

# Why I made it
The main reason I made this game was because I wanted a more sophisticated, professional-looking game that I actually take my time with and be proud of, adding many features to make it cooler and actual game-like. I've spent a LOT of time on this, so I really hope you enjoy it!

# How I made it
I made it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, similar to some of my other projects. However, this one is a lot more detailed in comparison. I mostly expanded on my CSS knowledge with this game, as I used a character above the main gameboard, which I don't usually do. I also used layered boxes for most of the images and elements in this game using CSS, which was mostly new to me, so that was interesting.

# What I struggled with and what I learned
I struggled with a lot of the programming since there were so many different functions by the end to keep track of. I also really struggled with the collision logic, since many things I tried just didn't work, and I had to spend ages debugging and testing other methods. This was mostly because of the CSS character being on a layer above the board instead of constructed by grid pieces, like the robot and gems, so I had to create a separate character back which stays aligned with the character visual. I learned quite a lot while making this game, mostly the CSS elements I mentioned earlier, but also expanded on my JavaScript and HTML knowledge.
